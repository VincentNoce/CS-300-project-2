# CS-300-project-2
Project 2  CS-300


A list of Computer Science courses was sorted and printed in alphanumeric order as part of Project Two. Designing and integrating a sorting algorithm into the codebase was the challenge here. In order to demonstrate an efficient and functional solution, I implemented a sorting algorithm.

Developing software for these projects has significantly broadened my approach to program development and software design. By evaluating factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and practical applicability, I have learned to evaluate tradeoffs between different data structures and algorithms. As a result of this experience, I have developed more nuanced problem-solving skills and gained a more nuanced understanding of what tools to choose for specific programming tasks.

In addition to influencing my approach to program writing, the evolution of these projects has affected how I maintain, read, and adapt my software. The modularity of the code is now a greater priority, encapsulating functionality into well-defined modules to make the code more readable. My programs are also designed in such a way that they are able to adapt to future changes without requiring major rework.
